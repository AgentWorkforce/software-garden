 * Factory's maintainability historian, cloud surface.

 * Review-kit owns the shared PR plumbing: event parsing, repository scoping,
 * draft and skip-label gates, checkout execution, output normalization, and
 * once-per-revision delivery. This file declares only the repository-specific
 * review doctrine and evidence.
 *
 * The doctrine lives in the checked-out repository rather than this handler.
 * That keeps the cloud reviewer aligned with Factory's versioned critical-path
 * catalog and lets a charter change take effect without duplicating it here.
