/**
 * One aggregate deadline for one discovery sweep.
 *
 * ## Why a per-call bound is not enough
 *
 * Three separate unbounded dependency calls have wedged this sweep in a single
 * day, each one real, each one bounded, and each time the wedge came back one
 * layer down:
 *
 *   - the FACTORY_STATE Durable Object calls (factory-cloud#78),
 *   - the relayfile change-feed tail reads (#368, shipped in 0.1.75),
 *   - the retry of the now-bounded call, which is itself unbounded.
 *
 * The pattern is structural, not incidental. A per-call deadline bounds ONE
 * await; a sweep is thousands of awaits plus every retry loop between them, so
 * "every call is bounded" never adds up to "the sweep is bounded". The
 * deployed 0.1.75 proves it: `readinessReconcile.state` reached `retrying`,
 * which means #368's deadline genuinely fires, and `inFlightMs` still climbed
 * with wall clock to 31 minutes on a 60-second interval.
 *
 * This module bounds the total instead. Time is charged against ONE timer for
 * the whole sweep, so it does not matter which await is slow, how many there
 * are, or how many times the sweep retries one of them: the sum cannot exceed
 * the budget. The next unbounded call is then a degraded sweep rather than the
 * end of dispatch.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot interrupt
 *
 * `run()` is a race, not a cancellation — the same honest limitation #368
 * documented for `withRelayfileCallDeadline`, and stated here for the same
 * reason: the next lane over has to be able to reason about what is left.
 *
 * It CAN abandon an in-flight await. Expiry rejects the sweep from inside
 * `#runOnceWithDiscoveryFence`, so the sweep's own teardown runs: the lease is
 * released and `#runOnceInFlight` is cleared, which is what lets the next cycle
 * start a fresh sweep instead of coalescing onto the wedged one. That is the
 * whole difference from the #296 sweep deadline, which rejected the *caller's
 * wait* and left `runOnce()` running for every later cycle to coalesce onto.
 *
 * It CANNOT stop the abandoned work. The socket stays open, the SDK's own
 * retry loop keeps running, and any side effect already in flight still lands.
 * Two things narrow that:
 *
 *   - `signal` aborts at expiry, so anything downstream that honours an
 *     `AbortSignal` is really cancelled. Nothing in the sweep consumes it yet
 *     (the relayfile client mints its own per-call signal, and that file is
 *     owned by another lane this week) — it is exported so the wiring is a
 *     one-line change rather than a redesign.
 *   - `assertNotExpired()` is a between-await check, which is worth exactly
 *     what #368 said it was worth — nothing against a call that never returns
 *     — but it does make an abandoned pass unwind at its next loop iteration
 *     if it ever regains control, instead of running to completion beside the
 *     sweep that replaced it.
