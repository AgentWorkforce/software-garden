/**
 * The aggregate sweep budget (#372).
 *
 * Three unbounded calls have wedged this sweep in one day, on three different
 * transports, each one bounded afterwards and each time the wedge returned one
 * layer down. So the subject here is not another call. It is the property that
 * a sweep cannot be in flight for longer than its budget REGARDLESS of what it
 * is waiting on — which is what turns the next unbounded call into a degraded
 * sweep instead of the end of dispatch.
 *
 * Every must-fire below hangs a call that never returns. Before this change
 * each one hangs the test itself, at vitest's 5 s default: that is the defect,
 * in the same shape production had it.
